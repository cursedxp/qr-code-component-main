## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use HTML5 to structure web content in a semantically meaningful way, which helps to improve the accessibility of web pages for all users. Additionally, I gained knowledge about how to create more accessible websites by using tools such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which allow me to provide additional context and information to assistive technologies used by people with disabilities. These skills have helped me become a more well-rounded and inclusive web developer, and I will continue to prioritize accessibility in all my future web development projects.
